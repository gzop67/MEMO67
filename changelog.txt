  [066-130123] - Minor cleanup. 

  [065-120123] - Added primitive remove function, untested.

  [064-110123] - Added primitive gid

  [063-100123] - Few cleanups.

  [062-090123] - Minor cleanups.

  [061-080123] - Fixed bug with bitmap text uvs.

  [060-070123] - Added bitmap text rendering, still some bugs to fix.

  [059-060123] - Temporary fix for depth buffer resolution mismatch for light pass.
  [058-060123] - Fixed bug with sprite batcher and normal data.

  [057-050123] - Cleaned up primitive_render code. Added some render stat stuff. Fixed HLSL deferred shaders.

  [056-040123] - Added depth buffer texture to opengl version of gbuffer pass, forgot about it.
  [055-040123] - Added functions to bind specific framebuffer slots.
               - Added functions to clear all render targets/attachments, necessary to individually clear for opengl
              as when attachments are of different size. (opengl renders the smallest of the attachments, so large ones are only partially
              cleared/drawn to when cleared together). Dx11 doesn't support rendertargets of different size, but they are cleared
              individually with ClearRenderTargetView() anyway." 

  [054-040123] - Added render view resize function.
               - Changed window creation to use AdjustWindowRect() (win32), necessary to get consistent resize between dx11 and opengl, 
               I think opengl's ndc are set with the initial gl context, so glViewport() sets the correct w/h without needing to adjust 
               to account for border/style sizes, whereas dx11 requires adjustment. Creating the window with AdjustWindowRect() normalises
               behaviour between dx11 and opengl.
  
  [053-030123] - Dx11 support for framebuffer stuff is in a working state.
               - Various API changes, relating to the new Dx11 changes.

  [052-020123] - Working on adding Dx11 support for the new framebuffer stuff.
               - Did a small 2.5D test (DST style). Cool.

  [051-010123] - Changelog updates.
  [050-010123] - Initial commits.

[changelog preface]

GitHub initial commit started at svn version [050], 010123.

[050-010123] contains the following features:

  -Framebuffer stuff.

  -Collisions (very basic, preemptive function).

  -Input handling (keyboard & mouse).

  -Timing (basic).

  -Line renderer.
    -Supports sdf-mode (as well as mesh mode) which renders lines as an sdf
      surface. Much slower, but cool.

  -SDF surface.
    -SDFs rendered in-shader with raymarching.
  
  -Camera (basic)
    -Orthographic and perspective.

  -Model, View, Projection matrices.

  -Matrices and Vectors (templated).
    -M4x4 matrices support SIMD multiplication.

  -Buffer resolution independence:
    -Lighting passes as well as final frame resolution can be set.

  -Lighting, directional and point.
    -Currently lights are deferred only. 
    -Rendered in two passes, first directional lights, then point lights.

  -Deferred rendering.
    -When deferred rendering is enabled, Goji's internal loop binds a deferred
    framebuffer, subsequent draw calls are then rendered to the gbuffer/s.
    Lighting is then rendered with the gbuffer/s as input (as well as lighting
    constant buffers) before finally rendering the frame to a quad.

  -Shader system:
    -Single .sha shader files are written containing both .hlsl and .glsl code, 
      the file separates the two shader languages, as well as vertex and pixel
      shaders with #defines.
    -Constant buffers.
    -Each 'default' (i.e part of Goji, not a custom added shader) shader corresponds to a enum value.
    -'Default' shaders include gbuffer variants, phong model, gouraud model, sprite, generic model, line, etc.

  -Sprite rendering with animation.

  -Sprite batcher.

  -OBJ model loader. (basic)

  -BMP image loader.

  -Dx11 and OpenGL3.3 backends. Current version [050] has not yet implemented
    Dx11 for the new framebuffer deferred stuff.

  -Custom data structures:
    -Dynamic array
    -Hashtable, current hash function starts with a constant and then uses a
      prime number table along with various circular shifts, additions,
      multiplications etc, works well enough for now.
    -Linked list (single)

Official start date 021122. - Project started 260922 with svn commit [001],
however, real work started on 021122 with svn commit [021].
